# raspberry-dht22-sms

This is currently a small project that enables automation of temperature and humidity monitoring.

The idea is to use a sensor and a Raspberry Pi to measure the temperature and humidity in order to notify the interested person when ever the two parameters cross a certain threshold via SMS.

The DHT22 (A2302) sensor is a digital relative humidity and temperature sensor. Find out more about the sensor in the [datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/Digital+humidity+and+temperature+sensor+AM2302.pdf)

The API used for sending SMS messages in this demo is [Nexmo SMS API](https://www.nexmo.com/)
